### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Pedro Pombeiro

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on CI Runner Fleet Management at GitLab.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Ruby-on-Rails and PostgreSQL development on a very large SaaS platform.
- âš¡ Fun facts:
  - I got introduced to coding when I was around 8 years old as a means of loading games into a Sinclar ZX81.
  - I've been working in fully distributed teams since 2014, and worked in hybrid teams for 13 years before that.

Skills: Ruby on Rails / Go / C# / Linux / Nix / Bash
